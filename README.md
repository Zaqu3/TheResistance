Steps to setting up repo on your local machine:
(Windows install!!! I can try to help anyone with mac configs if you need it just send me a message)
###############################################

1. Install Git Bash and make sure you have a github account
    - we can get free dev versions of guthub with our student status but
    you can also just go with the free version for this project because this 
    repo will be public

    -Git download
    https://git-scm.com/downloads

        - allow git bash to be installed and follow with the basic instructions
        - at the end DO NOT allow the experimental changes they are dumb

    -Website for account
    github.com


2. Once git is installed open git bash
    -this will look kind of like a command terminal

3. Navigate to the directory in which you would like the repo to be cloned to
    -this will require some bash commands
    - if you are not familiar with bash commands here is what you need to do:
        a. Open file explore and go to the folder where you want the repo to exist
        b. If you right click the line at the top of file explorer(the one that shows the path)
            you should get an option to "Copy Address as text"  <--- do this
                ex: in documents for me my path looks like "C:\Users\zach\Documents"


                IMPORTANT: You may need to replace above backslashes with forward slashes
                    mine was a bit inconsistent here


4. Now we should have the directory path copied so in bash terminal enter the following command
    -"cd <pathInsertedHere>" (delete the angular brackets)

        -Again if you get a "no such directory" error try replacing the backslashes with forward slashes

5. Once successfully at the desired location use the following command to clone the repo from github
onto your local machine

    -"git clone https://github.com/Zaqu3/TheResistance.git"

6. The repo should copy onto your machine at the specified location and you should now have a folder called "TheResistance"

7. Now we can use git commands after saving any file in this folder to upload the changes to the repository on github
