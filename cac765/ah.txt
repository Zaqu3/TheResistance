needed a file here

Adding a file to repository:
1. git pull (before making changes, git stash if changes already made)
2. git status (view what you've done)
3. git add . ( . to ad all or "" to add single file)
4. git commit -m "commit message" ( add description message)
5. git push (push final code)
6. git status (make sure code was pushed successfully)
